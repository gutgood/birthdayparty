    <h1>prize walk</h1>
<h1>How to play the game</h1>
<p>Write numbers from 1 to 30 on square charts and stick them on the ground, within a circle. Make smaller chits with the same numbers and shuffle them up in a basket. Play some music and have the children walk around the circle. Instruct them to stand on a number when the music stops. If their number is picked up from the basket, they will win a prize. The game can continue for a set number of rounds.</p>
<h1>Balloon Burst</h2>
<p>Write some challenges on chits paper and insert them into different balloons before inflating them. The kids will have to bop the balloon in the air for as long as the music is playing. When the music stops, the person who was the last to touch the balloon has to pop it and perform the challenge within it. It could be anything, like dancing, licking their elbow, etc. Get creative with your challenges.</p>
<h1>musical chairs</h1>
<h1>Balloon</h1>
<p>Using strings, tie inflated balloons to the ankle of every player. Now, play music and allow the entire party have a fun dancing session. The moment the music stops, they must try to pop the balloon of the person next to them, by stomping on it, while keeping their balloon safe. The person whose balloon bursts is out of the game. The last person standing with an intact balloon wins.</p>
